# Project-based learning for JS with weather app

**Date**: 2025-11-06

This is a weather app I created following [this tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-33893t) to better learn JavaScript and make AJAX calls.

To get weather data, I am using [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)'s free API.
